* Overview

*Yeis*, pronounced yes, is a more advanced input method switcher for Emacs.

It pretends to:

1) Transform text as if it had been inserted by any non-CJK input method;
2) Auto set the input method and auto transform text as it's typed (yeis-mode);

** Demo

Let's see it in action, for the sake of clarity. I'll be demonstrating it with
the russian input method selected (ЙЦУКЕН).

** Manual Transformation

Transform the previous word, the one to the left of the cursor, by calling
=yeis-transform-previous-word=. You can either call it with M-x or you can set
bind it to a key, such as C-| (see instructions below).

When you pass a prefix argument n, it transforms the last n words.

The following commands are equivalent ways to transforming 3 words that come
before the cursor.

- M-3 C-|
- C-u 3 C-|

Notice that you can always toggle your input method by calling
=toggle-input-method= (the default keybinding is C-\).

** Yeis-mode

By activating yeis-mode, you'll get auto transformation and auto input method
selection. It follows a DWIM (do-what-I-mean) philosophy.

Note that this is still under development, therefore unwanted behavior will
certainly happen. You can always call =yeis-transform-previous-word= to make the
necessary corrections.

* Quickstart

#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/aadcg/emacs-yeis.git
#+end_src

Please find in the table below the string that identifies the input method you
want to use.

Here's what you need to add to your init.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; yeis main file
  (load-file "/fullpath/to/yeis.el")

  ;; input methods' definitions
  (load-file "/fullpath/to/robin-packages.el")

  ;; loads the defined input methods
  (load-file "/fullpath/to/x-leim-list.el")

  ;; activate the desired input method, for instance robin-russian
  (setq default-input-method "robin-russian")
  (setq-default robin-current-package-name "robin-russian")

  ;; this is necessary if you want to use yeis minor mode
  (setq yeis-path-plain-word-list "/fullpath/to/wordlist/of/this/repo")

  ;; since C-\ is bind to `toggle-input-method', this seems a good choice
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-|") 'yeis-transform-previous-word)
#+end_src

* Input methods

At the moment the following input methods are supported:

| Name                  | Description                   |
|-----------------------+-------------------------------|
| robin-russian         | US qwerty <-> russian ЙЦУКЕН  |
| robin-russian-dvorak  | US dvorak <-> russian ЙЦУКЕН  |
| robin-russian-workman | US workman <-> russian ЙЦУКЕН |
| robin-greek           | US querty <-> Greek           |

It's trivial to add more. Let me know about your needs or, better yet, send me a
patch.

/Please note that I have only tested yeis-mode for the first one on the above
list./

* Roadmap

- Add support for more input methods out of the box (trivial task);
- Improve yeis-mode (namely it should take into account that users can make
  typos);
- Write unit tests (following a property-based philosophy);
- Write integration tests with the most common words;
- Better integration with GNU Aspell (can it check if a certain prefix exists in a
  given dictionary?)

* Rant about input methods

If your way of life is to live inside of Emacs, then you know how annoying it is
when you select a non QWERTY input method in your OS. Say you have the russian
input method active. Then you go to Emacs, you hit C-g and the minibuffer greets
you with:

=C-п is undefined=

Emacs wants us to have a QWERTY input method enabled. When in need of another
one, we should make use of its multilingual features (=M-x set-input-method=).
That way, keybindings will still work since keypresses prefixed by Meta or
Control are escaped (i.e. not transformed). On the other hand, it is a fact that
we can't (yet) do everything in Emacs. So, until that day of plenitude comes, we
shall need to change the input method in the operating system we're running (say
you want to write in Russian in your browser). A possible solution is to use
IBus (the default input method framework for GNOME). Out of the box, you get
input methods selected per application. Sweet! Some people have totally
different approaches - take a look at [[https://github.com/a13/reverse-im.el][reverse-im]] and [[https://github.com/mrkkrp/fix-input][fix-input]]. I shall not even
go in there.

Let's now talk about input methods within Emacs. It supports insertion of
multilingual text through Quail (have a look at quail.el) - indeed, a beautiful
piece of software, but it inherits unnecessary complexity when the users don't
use a CJK input method. I found out is that there's a lighter alternative to
Quail - Robin. The latter, provides transformation to and from any (non-CJK)
input method out of the box!

What Yeis wants to achieve within Emacs might be comparable to what [[https://xneur.ru][xneur]]
achieves for GNU/Linux.
