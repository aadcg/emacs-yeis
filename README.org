* Overview
Yeis, pronounced yes, is a more advanced input method switcher for Emacs.

Two goals:

- Translate text to and from a non-CJK input method on user's request;
- Do the above automatically by activating yeis minor mode.

Easier seen than read.

Currently, the only input method supported out of the box is russian. However,
the package was developed taking into account its expansibility to every non-CJK
characted input method. It is trivial to do it. If you want to understand why
please read the X section below.

* Quickstart

#+begin_src sh
cd foo-full-path
git clone url
#+end_src

And then add the following to your init.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file "foo-full-path")
  (setq default-input-method "robin/russian"
        yeis-path-plain-word-list "/home/aadcg/repos/yeis/wordlist")
  (setq-default robin-current-package-name "robin/russian")
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-|") 'translate-current-word)
#+end_src

* Roadmap

- Add more input methods;
- Improve yeis minor mode.
- write tests with most common words
- write custom grep/look function
- Integration with GNU Aspell (can it check if a certain prefix exists in a
  given dictionary?)

* Rant about input methods

If your way of life is to live inside of Emacs, then you know how annoying it is
to selected an input method for your system (say, russian) and then you hit C-g
and the minibuffer presents you with 'C-Ð¿ is undefined'.

Well, it is a fact that we can't (yet) do everything in Emacs. So, until the day
of Emacs plenitude comes, we shall need to change the input method in the
operating system you're running. However, from within Emacs, it's silly to have
the input method from the operating system enabled (recall that annoying
minibuffer I mentioned above). It's much better to set the input method for a
given buffer so that you your keybindings, which are prepended with modifier
keys, still get registered correctly. If you're enabling an input method on your
operating system to insert multilingual text on Emacs, then you're doing it
wrong. Emacs supports the insertion of multilingual text through quail.el. Quail
is indeed a beautiful piece of software. However, it also inherits unnecessary
complexity if you don't need input method for Japanese, Chinese or Korean.

What I would like to know is how can I set up input methods changes such that
they won't take effect inside of Emacs. If anyway knows that, I'd be very
grateful. That could be achieved with ibus.
