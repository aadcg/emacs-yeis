* Overview
Yeis, pronounced yes, is a more advanced input method switcher for Emacs.

It pretends to do two things:

- Provide a simple way to correct inserted text to match an input method;

- Provide the above automatically, i.e. without the user making the decision.
  This is called yeips minor mode.

Easier seen than read.

Currently, the only input method supported is russian. However, the package was
developed taking into account its expansibility to every non-CJK characted input
method. If you want to understand why please read the X section below.

* Quickstart

#+begin_src sh
cd foo-full-path
git clone url
#+end_src

And then add the following to your init.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "foo-full-path")
(setq default-input-method "robin/russian")
;; (setq-default robin-current-package-name "russian")
(global-set-key (kbd "C-|") 'convert-last-word)
#+end_src

* Rant about input methods

If your way of life is to live inside of Emacs, then you know how annoying it is
to selected an input method for your system (say, russian) and then you hit C-g
and the minibuffer presents you with 'C-Ð¿ is undefined'.

Well, it is a fact that we can't (yet) do everything in Emacs. So, until the day
of Emacs plenitude comes, we shall need to change the input method in the
operating system you're running. However, from within Emacs, it's silly to have
the input method from the operating system enabled (recall that annoying
minibuffer I mentioned above). It's much better to set the input method for a
given buffer so that you your keybindings, which are prepended with modifier
keys, still get registered correctly. If you're enabling an input method on your
operating system to insert multilingual text on Emacs, then you're doing it
wrong. Emacs supports the insertion of multilingual text through quail.el. Quail
is indeed a beautiful piece of software. However, it also inherits unnecessary
complexity if you don't need input method for Japanese, Chinese or Korean.

What I would like to know is how can I set up input methods changes such that
they won't take effect inside of Emacs. If anyway knows that, I'd be very
grateful. That could be achieved with ibus.
